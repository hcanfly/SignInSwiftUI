# SwiftUI Signin

Basic SwiftUI app for collecting user info for signup and validating its acceptability before enabling the Signup button. It creates a UserInfo class that uses Combine's CombineLatest function to provide a clean easy way to validate the input. Using Combine and a separate class removes validation code from the page view. Much nicer code.
